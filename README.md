# Pious_selase_GB_Conway_gol
A simple rust version of the famous conway game of life. This project is a command-line interface (CLI) version of the famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. Written in Rust, it leverages the language's performance and safety features to deliver a fast and interactive simulation of life-like patterns in a grid-based environment.

**HOW TO PLAY**
-> When prompted, enter the grid size (e.g., 10x10).  
-> Provide the coordinates of initial live cells (e.g., 1,1 2,2 3,3).  
-> Set the number of generations to simulate.  
-> Watch life evolve in your terminal!
